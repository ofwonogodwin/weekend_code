# Django Weekend Adventure 

I spent the weekend coding away, diving into Django

I had a blast building this little web app! ðŸŽ®

This project is a simple Django application, but itâ€™s packed with fun and a little bit of my weekend energy. 

## What I Built ðŸ› 

- A Django-powered web app with integrating Models
- Simple, clean, and fun to work on 
- [Optional: Add more features you enjoyed working on, like forms, templates, admin, etc.]

## How to Run It ðŸš€

I really encourage to try out my weekend creation (and I highly encourage it ðŸ˜Ž), follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
